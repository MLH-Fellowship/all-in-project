# All In - Project

For the last half of the program, you'll work in groups of 2 or 3 on a new project. Using all the skills you've learnt over the past few weeks, you'll put those into practice with this project!

## Task

You're going to be building a blog for yourself to share your experiences on your programming journey! The website needs a few things to make it functional:
- [ ] A list of blog posts to read
- [ ] Page for each blog post
- [ ] Contact form
- [ ] A way to favorite posts and come back to them 
- [ ] Calculating the length of each post in time to read.

You should aim to achieve the above tasks by the end of the program. You should break them into smaller sub tasks and work as a team to build this blog!

This is open ended so feel free to add extras and design this website how you like. You can decide what the store sells (keep it safe for work!).

## Technologies

This repository is using Jekyll. You'll use this to allow you to build a HTML website using templates!

When you create a task, you should add it as an **Issue** in your repository and assign yourself to it. Every task should be worked on inside of its own branch and a Pull Request should be submitted when it's ready for review by the rest of your group and Pod Leader.

## Resources

Jekyll may be new to a load of you and that's super exciting!

Jekyll has a load of documentation to help get folks started: [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)


Jekyll uses liquid to help you build templates. Read more here: [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/)
