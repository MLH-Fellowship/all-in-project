    <h2>Why I Chose Computer Science</h2>
    <p>I decided to major in Computer Science shortly after my separation from the United States Air Force after nine years of honorable service.  
      I wasn't sure about attending college due to the fact I did not really know what I would major in.  The first thing I did was try and remember
       what classes I was good at and then things I was good at naturally growing up.  What I realized was that I excelled in Math, History, and English.  
       Also, I was always interested in how things work/operate, and I was very analyitcal as well and good at putting two and two together.  
       That is when becoming a Computer Scientist entered my mind and I made the decision that this is what I'd major in.</p>
