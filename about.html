                <h2>Adrian Whitehurst</h2>
                <p id="borderimg2"> Hello, I am currently a Sophomore studying Computer Science at the illustrious Clark Atlanta University. Prior to that, I served in the United States Air Force for nine years where I excelled as a Staff Sergeant (E-5) in the Transportation/Logistics career field. I've lived in California, Florida and South Korea. I chose to major in Computer Science because I love problem solving and figuring out how to improve upon something or make it more efficient. Also, the world of computing is so vast and floating with endless knowledge, that I just want to learn as much as possible.</p>
