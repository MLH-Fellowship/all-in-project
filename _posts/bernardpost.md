#**How This Journey In Open-Source Programming Started**

##LOL, I Promise This will not take long to read
Yes, this whole journey started with an email from the department Dean of my school that I had been selected to participate as one of the student pioneer of a new program by GitHub called {All-In}. Soon I would attend an introductory meeting in which I met 30 other student participants from various select HBCUs around the country. After introductions, we were explained about the program and how it's mission was to increase the participation of people of color in Open-Source programming. The program was going to first help us learn various open-Source programming rules of engagement through a fall semester Introduction to Open-Source course on Linux Foundation. Although I was very nervous about the whole idea of programming (I did not have a solid foundation in programming, so my confidence to succeed in this program was extremely low. I though I was not going to succeed and always thought to myself they had made a wrong selection). Afterwards we would begin our Open-Source programming journey on Linux Foundation and would also attend monthly meetings to build relationships and receive any updates. At the end of the fall semester, I had completed the intro to Open-source course, and I can say I was somewhat starting to believe in myself, but was still very nervous about the hands-on programming chapter of the program that was coming the following semester with Major League Hacking.
