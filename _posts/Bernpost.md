#**Diving Deep Into The Actual Programming Segment of All-In**

##Just Seat Tight and Enjoy This Journey With Me

The day I received an email from Major league hacking sometime in December 2021 is the day I almost thought of quitting. I was back in South Africa for the fall break. They wanted us to complete a web-development project on our own using CSS and HTML to gauge our individual skill-level so that they would have a better understanding of the individual assistance we needed. Of course I had taken a CSS and HTML course in my CIS class, but I had just done it to pass because I had told myself that I was not going to be a hands programmer but a program manager or something to do with technology requiring me to know about various IT stuff but as long as I was not the one doing the programming. So, I did not know how I was going to do that project within the few weeks deadline. Fortunately, I am a believer that the most difficult part of achieving anything is taking the first step, so I told myself that I was going to do it and succeed; I just had to take the first step. Yes, one night I found myself opening my notepad typing in my first HTML tag element, and I would never bail out since until I completed my simple bio webpage and submitted it before the deadline. Afterwards, my confidence to succeed in the program was greatly boosted. It's not like I was scared of losing anything If I had not succeeded, but I am someone who does not like to disappoint the people who believe in me. I knew they had seen something in me and decided to select me into the program, therefore I was going to search within me and unleash those programming super powers. Now, looking at how much I have gained and achieved through this journey, I can honestly say that decision to dive 'all in' was the greatest turning point of my career that I will always remember!
